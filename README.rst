============
ljpeg
============


     Read and transform LJPEG images into modern formats.

Warning: You must have installed flex on your operating system.

Convert to TIFF (requires the .ics file in the same directory as LJPEG)::

     ljpeg $(pwd)/C_0029_1.LEFT_CC.LJPEG $(pwd)/output.tiff


Convert to TIFF and verify that no information has been lost::

      ljpeg $(pwd)/C_0029_1.LEFT_CC.LJPEG $(pwd)/output.tiff --verify

Convert to jpeg for visualization with down-sizing scale=0.3 (16-bit TIFF is not good for direct visualization)::

      ljpeg $(pwd)/C_0029_1.LEFT_CC.LJPEG $(pwd)/output.jpg --visual --scale 0.3

Note that output file can be any format that's supported by OpenCV (which includes all common types). Most file formats only support 8-bit images, so directly saving into such file formats will cause problems. Add "--visual" to normalize color into 8-bit before saving to such file formats.

The Stanford ljpeg code is in public domain and is therefore OK to be included here. I did minor modification to make the code compile under modern Linux.

Getting started
=================
Download a set of mammograms with::

     wget -q ftp://figment.csee.usf.edu:21/pub/DDSM/cases/normals/normal_08/case4606/ && cat index.html | grep -oP '"ftp.*"' | sed s/\"//g | parallel wget

Transform a lot of mammograms parallely::

     find "$(pwd)" -type f -name '*.LJPEG' | parallel -j+0 "ljpeg {} $(pwd)/{/.}.tiff --verify"

Making Changes & Contributing
=============================

This project uses `pre-commit`_, please make sure to install it before making any
changes::

    pip install pre-commit
    cd demo-project
    pre-commit install

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version::

    pre-commit autoupdate

Don't forget to tell your contributors to also install and use pre-commit.
